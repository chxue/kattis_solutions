This is a collection of solutions to problems on open.kattis.com. Difficulty levels are not accurate since they keep changing. File names are problem ids unless the id begins with a number, in which case the file name becomes P<id>. To search for a problem, visit open.kattis.com/problems/<id>.

Although there are hints to the harder questions, solutions are not documented so it could be quite hard to follow sometimes. Please email me at cx94.main@gmail.com for clarification.
